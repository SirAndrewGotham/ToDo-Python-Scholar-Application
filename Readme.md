# Todo Python Scholar Application

# Three apps: cli, gui and web

This project includes three versions of the same thing: cli, gui and web apps, which can be run respectively.

## CLI app

Command line (CLI) application uses three files:

- cli.py;
- functions.py (containing the necessary functions and shared across all 3 apps)
- todos.txt (text file with todos, will be created if not exists)

Command line application is supposed to be run in a terminal and preforms tasks within text-based interface.

## GUI app

GUI (Graphoc User Inrface) application uses three files:

- gui.py;
- functions.py (containing the necessary functions and shared across all 3 apps)
- todos.txt (text file with todos, will be created if not exists)

GUI application â€” when run - starts a dedicated graphic interface and is designed to be used on a desktop computer with a whatever operation system it has: Windows, Mac or Lynux.

GUI app needs a python interpreter to run.

## Web app

Web application uses four files:

- web.py;
- functions.py (containing the necessary functions and shared across all 3 apps)
- todos.txt (text file with todos, will be created if not exists)
- requirements.txt (libraries to install on the server list)

Web application when started can be used via a browser with a local server address.

This application can also be uploaded to a server on the Internet.

This web app is being prepared with streamlit library.


# What it's all about...

I am studying Python from scratch, and this is just what I build along the way.

Nothing special, ordinary ToDo list.

With that said, cli app has a text-baed interface, gui app can be compiled into an executable and run on a desktop/laptop computer, and web app can be uploaded to a web server or run locally.
